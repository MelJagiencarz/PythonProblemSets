# Problem Sets Repository

This repository contains eight problem sets, each designed to gradually increase in difficulty. The topics covered are essential programming concepts, with exercises that build upon each other for deeper understanding.

## Topics
1. **Functions** – Introduction to defining and using functions.
2. **Variables** – Understanding variables and data types.
3. **Conditionals** – Implementing decision-making in code.
4. **Loops** – Mastering repetition with loops.
5. **Exceptions** – Handling errors and exceptions.
6. **Libraries** – Utilizing external libraries to enhance functionality.
7. **Unit Tests** – Writing tests to ensure code quality.
8. **File I/O** – Reading from and writing to files.
9. **Regular Expressions** – Pattern matching and text processing.
10. **Object-Oriented Programming** – Exploring classes, objects, and OOP principles.

Each problem set progressively increased in difficulty, and allowed me to develop my coding skills step by step.
