# Problem Sets Repository

This repository contains eight problem sets, each designed to gradually increase in difficulty. The topics covered are essential programming concepts, with exercises that build upon each other for deeper understanding.

## Topics
0. **Functions, Variables** – Introduction to defining and using functions and understanding variables and data types.
2. **Conditionals** – Implementing decision-making in code.
3. **Loops** – Mastering repetition with loops.
4. **Exceptions** – Handling errors and exceptions.
5. **Libraries** – Utilizing external libraries to enhance functionality.
6. **Unit Tests** – Writing tests to ensure code quality.
7. **File I/O** – Reading from and writing to files.
8. **Regular Expressions** – Pattern matching and text processing.
9. **Object-Oriented Programming** – Exploring classes, objects, and OOP principles.

Each problem set allowed me to develop my coding skills step by step. The exercises were provided by Harvard's CS50, being the ones that i had to made and overcome to get graduated in the course.
